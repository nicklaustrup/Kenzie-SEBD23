     * Takes a queue of integers as a parameter and returns true if the numbers in the queue represent a palindrome
     * (and false otherwise). A sequence of numbers is considered a palindrome if it is the same in reverse order.
     * For example, suppose a queue called q stores these values:
     *
     * front [3, 8, 17, 9, 17, 8, 3] back
     *
     * Then the call to isPalindrome(q); should return true because this sequence is the same in reverse order.
     *
     * If the queue had instead stored these values:
     *
     * front [3, 8, 17, 9, 4, 17, 8, 3] back
     *
     * The call to isPalindrome would instead return false because this sequence is not the same in reverse order
     * (the 9 and 4 in the middle don't match).
     *
     * The empty queue should be considered a palindrome. You may not make any assumptions about how many elements are
     * in the queue and your method must restore the queue so that it stores the same sequence of values after the call
     * as it did before.
     *

     * @return true if the numbers in the queue represent a palindrome, false otherwise
