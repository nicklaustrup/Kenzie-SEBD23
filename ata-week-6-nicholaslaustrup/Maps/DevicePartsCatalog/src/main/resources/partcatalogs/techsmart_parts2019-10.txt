3. Description
The MLX91217 is a monolithic Hall-effect sensor
which is sensitive to the flux density applied
orthogonally to the IC surface. The sensor
provides an analog output voltage proportional to
the applied magnetic flux density.
The transfer characteristic of the MLX91217 is
factory trimmed over temperature, and is
programmable (offset, sensitivity, clamping,
filtering) during end-of-line customer calibration.
The output clamping levels and on-chip filtering
are also programmable as a function of
application needs. With the 250kHz bandwidth
and fast response time, it is particularly adapted
for high speed applications such as inverters and
converters where fast response time due to fast
switching is required.
In a typical current sensing application, the sensor
is used in combination with a ring shaped soft
ferromagnetic core. This core is recommended to
be laminated for high bandwidth applications. The
MLX91217 is placed in a small air gap and the
current conductor – a bus bar or a cable – is
passed through the inner part of the
ferromagnetic ring. On the one hand the ring
concentrates and amplifies the magnetic flux seen
by the sensor IC, and at the same time it
attenuates external magnetic field disturbances.
CD120 Draw Wire Encoders
BEI Sensors / Sensata CD120 Draw Wire Encoders combine a rotary encoder with a rotating drum. The drum is coupled to the encoder shaft so that as the wire moves out and in, the encoder rotates to produce signal proportional movement. These encoders feature an IP65 rating, up to 10ft measurement capability, and ±5% FS linearity. The CD120 encoders offer resistance to dust and moisture, consisting of a cavity to drain moisture accumulation. These encoders are less expensive than machinist scales. The CD120 encoders are built so that 1 revolution equals 1 foot of travel. The mounting foot and encoder can be rotated in 90° increments to meet any mounting requirement. The CD120 encoders are ideal for use in harsh environments, lift truck mast position, automated sawing, transportation, HVOR construction, landscaping, demolition, and flood control gates.
Introduction
The HMT25 geared multi-turn encoder provides absolute position
information over multiple turns of the input shaft. It keeps track of the
exact position even during periods of power loss without the need for
a battery backup. The HMT25 series is capable of outputs up to 4096
counts per turn and can count up to 4096 turns—a total of 24 bits or
16,777,216 positions. Units are enclosed in a 2.5- inch diameter sealed
package to withstand rugged environments and they carry an IP 66
environmental rating. These encoders meet the long travel and high
resolution requirements of robotics, rolling mills, rotary tables, cable
winding, printing, converting and material handling systems

TLE4966 Hall Sensors
Infineon TLE4966 Hall Sensors feature two integrated and calibrated sensor elements for detecting direction and counting indexes. This feature eliminates the need for a second sensor and cuts engineering and production costs. Using just one sensor also raises system quality and reliability. The TLE4966V is a further development of the TLE4966 family. The TLE4966V has the vertical orientation of the Hall plates which results in in-plane field sensitivity and enables entirely new application layouts. Designed in new technology, the TLE4966V offers high voltage capabilities with very small current consumption. The TLE4966V can be operated from unregulated power supplies, which offers our customers unique freedom of design for their system.
DRV5055/DRV5055-Q1 Linear Hall Effect Sensor
Texas Instruments DRV5055/DRV5055-Q1 Ratiometric Linear Hall Effect Sensor responds proportionally to magnetic flux density. The device can be used for accurate position sensing in a wide range of applications. The DRV5055/DRV5055-Q1 operates from 3.3V or 5V power supplies. When no magnetic field is present, the analog output drives half of VCC. The output changes linearly with the applied magnetic flux density, and four sensitivity options enable maximal output voltage swing based on the required sensing range. North and south magnetic poles produce unique voltages. Magnetic flux perpendicular to the top of the package is sensed, and the two package options provide different sensing directions. The device uses a ratiometric architecture that can eliminate error from VCC tolerance when the external analog-to-digital converter (ADC) uses the same VCC for its reference. Additionally, the DRV5055/DRV5055-Q1 features magnet temperature compensation to counteract how magnets drift for linear performance across a wide –40°C to 125°C temperature range. The DRV5055-Q1 devices are AEC-Q100 qualified for automotive applications.
