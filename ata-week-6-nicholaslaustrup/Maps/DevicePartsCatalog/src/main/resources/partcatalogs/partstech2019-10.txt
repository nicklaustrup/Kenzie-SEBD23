Description
The XC9572XL is a 3.3V CPLD targeted for high-performance, low-voltage applications in leading-edge communications and computing systems. It is comprised of four
54V18 Function Blocks, providing 1,600 usable gates with
propagation delays of 5 ns. See Figure 2 for overview.
Power Estimation
Power dissipation in CPLDs can vary substantially depending on the system frequency, design application and output
loading. To help reduce power dissipation, each macrocell
in a XC9500XL device may be configured for low-power
mode (from the default high-performance mode). In addition, unused product-terms and macrocells are automatically deactivated by the software to further conserve power.
For a general estimate of ICC, the following equation may be
used:
ICC(mA) = MCHS(0.175*PTHS + 0.345) + MCLP(0.052*PTLP
+ 0.272) + 0.04 * MCTOG(MCHS +MCLP)* f
where:
MCHS = # macrocells in high-speed configuration
PTHS = average number of high-speed product terms
per macrocell
MCLP = # macrocells in low power configuration
PTLP = average number of low power product terms per
macrocell
f = maximum clock frequency
MCTOG = average % of flip-flops toggling per clock
(~12%)
This calculation was derived from laboratory measurements
of an XC9500XL part filled with 16-bit counters and allowing
a single output (the LSB) to be enabled. The actual ICC
value varies with the design application and should be verified during normal system operation. Figure 1 shows the
above estimation in a graphical form. For a more detailed
discussion of power consumption in this device, see Xilinx

MADP-011104 Shunt PIN Diodes
MACOM MADP-011104 Shunt Positive Intrinsic Negative (PIN) Diodes are high-power shunt diodes that provide a good switch or attenuator performance from 50MHz to 5GHz. The MADP-011104 diodes feature 350W Continuous Wave (CW) incident power handling, 0.15dB insertion loss, and 29dB isolation at 3GHz frequency. These PIN diodes are available in a 3mm, 12-lead, and lead-free Quad Flat No-leads (QFN) plastic package. The MADP-011104 diodes are suited for switch and attenuator applications from HF through S-band. These applications require high peak and CW power, lower loss, and high linearity surface-mount assemblies. The MADP-011104 diodes are sensitive to ESD and require proper ESD control techniques.
Features
 350 W CW Incident Power Handling @ 3 GHz
 0.15 dB Insertion Loss @ 3 GHz
 29 dB Isolation @ 3 GHz
 Lead-Free 3 mm 12-lead QFN Package

Description
The MADP-011104 is a high-power PIN diode
assembled in a lead-free 3 mm 12-lead QFN plastic
package. This shunt device provides exceptional
switch or attenuator performance from 50 MHz to 5
GHz.
This compact device is ideally suited to switch and
attenuator applications from HF through S band,
where higher peak and CW power, lower loss, and
higher linearity surface-mount diode assemblies are
required.
Features

Description
The MA4L and MADL Series are silicon PIN limiter
diodes with small and medium I-region lengths
which are specifically designed for high signal
applications. The devices are designed to provide
low insertion loss, at zero bias, as well as low flat
leakage power with fast signal response/recovery
times. Parts are available as discrete die or
assembled into a variety of surface mount or
ceramic pill packages. See the Available Case Style
table for the specific ceramic package styles and
their availability for individual part numbers.
Applications
The MA4L and MADL Series of PIN limiter diodes
are designed for use in passive limiter control
circuits to protect sensitive receiver components
such as low noise amplifiers (LNA), detectors, and
mixers covering the 10 MHz to 18 GHz frequency
range
