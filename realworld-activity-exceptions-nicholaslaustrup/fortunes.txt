You may see a stranger across a crowded room.
Silly rabbit, fortunes are for kids.
Fortune favors the prepared!
It has been a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. Move to Australia.
The sun will come out tomorrow.
All your wildest dreams will come true.
Lucky at cards, unlucky in love.
If you want the rainbow, you got to put up with the rain.
People who need people, are the luckiest people in the world.
We're fools whether we dance or not so we might as well dance.
You are fortune's fool.
