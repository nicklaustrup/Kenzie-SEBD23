Here is some pseudocode to help get you started.

```
// For each inspector inspect the cookie

// If there aren't any cookie boxes yet, assemble one and add the cookie to it.

// If there already are cookie boxes, find the last cookie box and put the cookie in there if you can, 
   otherwise assemble a new box.
```

If you have tried to write the code using this pseudocode above but still need a little more help, here is it broken
down one step further in [hint 2](hint02.md).
